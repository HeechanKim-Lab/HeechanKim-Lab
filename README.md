# 👋 Hi, I'm Heechan Kim 
**Computational Biophysicist in Training | Junior @ Dong-A University**

I am an undergraduate student double majoring in **Molecular Engineering** and **Computer Science**. My goal is to become a researcher who understands biological systems through the lens of fundamental physics and translates that insight into executable computational models.

---

### 🔬 Current Research
- **Lab:** [Plant Immunity & Epigenetics Laboratory](https://web.donga.ac.kr/hwjung/page02.htm)
- **Focus:** Leveraging computational tools to analyze genomic data and understand epigenetic regulation in plant defense systems.
- **Status:** Currently transitioning from wet-lab foundations to full-stack biological data analysis.

### 📚 The "Footage" of My Journey
I maintain a transparent record of my growth, separating foundational theory from formal research applications.

* **[Computational-Biophysics-Roadmap](https://github.com/HeechanKim-Lab/Computational-Biophysics-Roadmap)**: My interdisciplinary "sketchbook." It contains implementations of concepts from Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Statistical Mechanics as applied to molecular systems.
* **[Plant-Epigenomics-Lab-Log](https://github.com/HeechanKim-Lab/Plant-Epigenomics-Lab-Log)**: Formal documentation of my work at the Plant Immunity & Epigenetics Laboratory. This includes data processing pipelines and computational outcomes derived from real-world biological datasets.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
- **Languages:** Python (Primary), C++, SQL, C
- **Scientific Computing:** NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Logic Pro (Signal Processing/Acoustics), Linux/Unix Shell, Git/GitHub
- **Fields:** Molecular Modeling, Computer Architecture, Network Management
