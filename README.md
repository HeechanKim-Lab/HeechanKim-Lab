# 👋 Hi, I'm Heechan Kim 
**Computational Biophysicist in Training | Junior @ Dong-A University**

I am an undergraduate student double majoring in **Molecular Engineering** and **Computer Science**. My goal is to become a researcher who understands biological systems through the lens of fundamental physics and translates that insight into executable computational models.

### 🔬 Current Research
- **Lab:** [Plant Immunity & Epigenetics Laboratory](https://web.donga.ac.kr/hwjung/page02.htm)
- **Focus:** Leveraging computational tools to analyze genomic data and understand epigenetic regulation in plant defense systems.
- **Status:** Currently transitioning from wet-lab foundations to full-stack biological data analysis.

### 📚 The "Footage" of My Journey
I treat my GitHub as a living archive of my interdisciplinary studies. You can find my progress in:
- **[Theoretical Roadmap]:** My self-directed curriculum covering Linear Algebra, Statistical Mechanics, and Electromagnetism.
- **[Bio-Simulations]:** Implementing biological models (enzyme kinetics, population dynamics) in Python.
- **[Data Pipelines]:** SQL and Python workflows for processing large-scale biological datasets.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
- **Languages:** Python (Primary), C++, SQL, C
- **Scientific Computing:** NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Logic Pro (Signal Processing/Acoustics), Linux/Unix Shell, Git/GitHub
- **Fields:** Molecular Modeling, Computer Architecture, Network Management
